## Hardware
These are the hardware design files. They're almost certainly terrible. Replicate this device at your own peril.

## Software
The Raspberry Pi Compute Module is installed with standard Raspbian. Configuration of the switching functions of the KSZ9477 are done via scripts communicating via the SPI bus. Configuration of routing functions are as per standard Linux methods.
